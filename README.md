    children: [
     Positioned.fill(
        child: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
      ),
     ),
     Positioned.fill(
         child: FloatingBubbles(
         noOfBubbles: 25,
         colorOfBubbles: Colors.green.withAlpha(30),
         sizeFactor: 0.16,
         duration: 120,//120 seconds. 
    ),
 );
 ```

         child: FloatingBubbles.alwaysRepeating(
         noOfBubbles: 25,
